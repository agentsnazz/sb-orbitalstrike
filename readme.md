OrbitalStrike
=============

v1.1:
* Code more generalized, will use same orbitalstrike.lua script for all
* Created 'carpet' and 'point' strike patterns

v1.0:
* Created carpet bomb target, craftable via tabularasa
* Carpet bomb is mostly POC at this point
* target spawns bombs offscreen to the left of the target, watch out!
